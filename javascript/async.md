# asynchronous javascript

## Callbacks
As it grows, it is difficult to read, debug and maintain, it leads to callback hell.

## Promises



## Async Await

* async/await is syntactic sugar around promises & 
provides a way to handle the asynchronous tasks in a synchronous manner. 
* async function always returns a promise.
* async functions can contain zero or more await expressions. 
Await expressions make promise-returning functions behave as though they're synchronous.
