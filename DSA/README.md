# data structures & algorithms


## Cherry Picked Algorithms
 * [Balanced Brackets](balanced-brackets.md)
 * [Inflight Movies](inflight-movies.md)
 * [Unique Substrings](unique-substrs.md)

## why Big O notation?
 It helps benchmark different algorithms by means of:
* Space Complexity
* Time Complexity


## Quick Facts:
 * Sudoku: DFS (Depth First Search)
 * Stack: stack of plates (last in first out LIFO)
 * Queue: queue at the supermarket (first-in first-out FIFO)
